# Backend Documentation
## Setting Up the Backend
To get the backend running, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm i`
2. Set up your `.env` file
3. Set up the database
4. Run `npm start`

### Installing Packages
Before the backend can function properly, all required packages must be installed.

Navigate to the server folder and run:

`npm i`

This installs all dependencies listed in the package.json file.

### Setting Up The .env File
Create a .env file in the server folder. Use the following template:

``` conf
# DB Config envs
DB_NAME=          # Defaults to recipedb
DB_HOST=          # Defaults to localhost
DB_PASSWORD=      # Does not have a default
DB_USER=          # Defaults to root

# Token Secret env
JWT_SECRET=       # Does not have a default

# Server Port env
PORT=             # Defaults to 5001

# Frontend URI env
FRONTENDURI=      # Defaults to http://localhost:3000
```

Ensure that the environment variables align with your MySQL and frontend setup.

### Setting Up the Database
This server uses MySQL. Download the latest version and configure it according to your environment. Make sure the database credentials in your `.env` file match your MySQL setup.

Once configured, run the following script to create the database and its tables:

`npm run updateTables`

This script handles the full database and table creation process.

#### Optional Development Scripts
`npm run createData` - Fills the database with dummy data for testing.

`npm run deleteData` - Deletes all data from every table. Useful for resetting the database during development.

Note: These scripts are intended for development only and should not be used in production.

### Starting the Backend Server
Once everything is set up, start the server with:

`npm start`

The backend will begin listening for API calls on the specified port.

## Security Implementations
### JWT & Cookie Authentication
User authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in conjunction with HTTP cookies.

Upon login, a token is generated containing the user's userId.

This token is returned to the client in a HTTP cookie and must be included with all subsequent requests.

The server uses this token to verify the userâ€™s identity and ensure they have the necessary permissions to access the requested resources.

### Prepared Statements
All SQL queries use prepared statements to mitigate the risk of SQL injection attacks.

### CORS

### Input Sanitization
